# MyCRUD
This repo contains the website i did with vanilla PHP, a SQLite database and Bootstrap.

I did this project as an exercise to refresh my PHP skills and play a bit more with databases and Bootstrap.

It's my first take at making a website from scratch, and also making my own registration/login feature (with a session that stays active).

## Installation
Github Pages doesn't support PHP; if you want to take a look at the project, you can clone/download it.

You'll just need to have PHP on your computer and run ```php -S localhost:8000``` from the folder.
