# MyCRUD
This repo contains the website i did with :

- PHP
- SQLite database
- Bootstrap.

It's made to share songs by quoting really good rhymes and adding details about the source and the artist.

I did this project as an exercise to refresh my PHP skills and play a bit more with databases and Bootstrap.

It's my first take at making a website from scratch, and also making my own features : 

- Login/Registration
- Files uploading
- Forms with validation and errors
- Dynamic pagination
- Basic security

# Installation
Github Pages doesn't support PHP; if you want to take a look at the project, you can clone/download it (that's why i left the database).

You'll just need to have PHP on your computer and run ```php -S localhost:8000``` from the folder (in your terminal).

To see all the interesting features you will have to be logged, feel free to make a fake account just to test it.


> This project is only in French, but i'm planning on making a more accessible website with the same concept (using Laravel this time) soon.
