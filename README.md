# MyCRUD
This repo contains the website i did with vanilla PHP, a SQLite database and Bootstrap.

I did this project as an exercise to refresh my PHP skills and play a bit more with databases and Bootstrap.

It's my first take at making a website from scratch, and also making my own registration/login feature (with a session that stays active).
